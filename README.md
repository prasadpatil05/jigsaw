# Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments

The Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge is a  classification task in which we are asked to build models to classify comments as one or more of the following categories: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, or identity hate. The goal of the challenge is to develop models that can accurately classify comments and assign a toxicity score to them.

In this competition we will be ranking comments in order of severity of toxicity. We are given a list of comments, and each comment should be scored according to their relative toxicity. Comments with a higher degree of toxicity should receive a higher numerical value compared to comments with a lower degree of toxicity.

This notebook provides an approach to solve the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. The following sections provide an overview of the steps taken to prepare the data, extract features, train and fine-tune the model, and evaluate its performance.

: Libraries used :

numpy: A library for numerical computing in Python.

pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: A library for data visualization.

seaborn: A library for data visualization built on top of matplotlib.

sklearn: A library for machine learning in Python. It provides tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, model evaluation, and more.

nltk: A library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python. It provides tools for text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, and more.

re: A library for regular expressions in Python. It provides tools for pattern matching and string manipulation.

step1:Data Preparation

The first step in any machine learning project is to prepare the data. In this notebook, we load the dataset from Kaggle using the pandas library. We perform some basic preprocessing steps such as removing stopwords, converting text to lowercase, etc. We also split the data into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library.
  In this , 
 Stemming :
The process of removing a part of a word, or reducing a word to its stem or root.
Example :
Let’s assume we have a set of words — send, sent and sending. All three words are different tenses of the same root word send. So after we stem the words, we’ll have just the one word — send.
 Word Embedding :
Word embedding is one of the most popular representation of document vocabulary. It is capable of capturing context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc.

Word Embeddings are vector representations of a particular word.

step2:Feature Extraction

The next step is to extract features from the text data. In this notebook, we use the Tf-idf vectorizer to extract features from the text. The Tf-idf vectorizer converts the text into a matrix of numbers, where each row represents a document (i.e., a comment) and each column represents a unique word. The values in the matrix represent the frequency of the word in the document weighted by its inverse frequency 

step3:Model Selection and Training

After extracting the features, we train multiple models such as Logistic Regression on the extracted features and compare their performance. We use the sklearn library to train the models and evaluate their performance on the validation set.

step4:Model Fine-tuning

Once we have identified the best-performing model, we fine-tune it by tuning its hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. GridSearchCV is a function from the sklearn library that exhaustively searches over a specified parameter grid for the best parameters to use for a given model.

step5:Model Evaluation

Finally, we evaluate the final model's performance on the test set and report the metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, etc. We use the sklearn library to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.

Conclusion

This notebook provides an end-to-end approach to solve the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
